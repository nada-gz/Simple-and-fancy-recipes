        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Add the eggs, water, and memmi seasoning sauce into a pourable cup and beat well with a whisk until fully combined. Heat a tamagoyaki pan over medium heat and apply a bit of oil. Pour a thin layer of the egg mixture and scramble for the first few seconds.</li><br>
            <li>Allow the egg to set in an even layer until it's about 70% cooked and the surface is still wet. Roll up the egg into an omelet and set it to one side of the pan. Lightly oil the pan and pour another thin layer of egg mixture into the pan.</li><br>
            <li>Lift the omelet to allow the egg mixture to flow under it. Slightly scramble the eggs for a few seconds and allow them to set into an even layer. Pop large bubbles as you see them for even cooking.</li><br>
            <li>When the egg mixture is about 70% cooked but the surface is still wet, gently roll the omelet to the other side of the pan. Continue cooking and rolling each layer until the egg mixture is used up.</li><br>
            <li>Remove the tamagoyaki from the pan and allow it to rest on a cutting board to get clean slices. When it's warm to the touch, slice into thick slices and serve.</li>
        </ul>
